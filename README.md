Decision Tree Classifier:
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier for machine learning. 
The notebook includes steps for preparing data, training the model, evaluating results, and visualizing the decision tree.

Features:
- Load and clean data
- Explore data with visualizations
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Display the decision tree

Requirements:
Before running the notebook, install the necessary libraries:
bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

How to Use:
1. Download or clone this project:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/youractualusername/DecisionTree.git
   cd DecisionTree
2. Open the notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook DecisionTree.ipynb
3. Run each cell to load data, train the model, and see results.

Dataset:
The notebook uses a classification dataset. 
Make sure the dataset is in the correct folder or update the code to load it from the right location.

Results:
- Shows model accuracy and performance.
- Displays a visual representation of the decision tree.
